RTS-Mini is a simple experiment in game design, boiling down an RTS and tower defense game into a curses-based application.

The game is played in 10 rounds to defeat an approaching enemy.  To do this, you buy workers (farmers, wood-cutters, miners) who can create resources (food, wood, and gold), or buy soldiers (archers, gunners) to attack the enemy.  You can also purchase skills, which improve abilities.

The game is played in real-time over 10 rounds, with score being the time required to defeat each of the 10 enemies.
